# Frontend-Mentor-Challenge-Stats-preview-card-component
My first challenge on Frontend Mentor.
This is my first challenge on frontend mentor, I tried my best to make a very similar design.
## What i learned :
### background-blen-mode :
it's my first time using this property, the result wasnt excately identical to the project but its gets the job done.
### media queys :
i tried to use media query for many screens size to make the design responsive as much as possible.

## Dificulties :
### html picture tag:
i tried to use the html picture tag and make different image for different screen size but i failed, so i used background-image onn css unstead.
### overflow : hidden:
i used overflow hidden so the image can take the border radius from its parent, but that's affect also the text that dispear.
